# Company Overview (v2025_02_15) — few-shot

You will write the **Company Overview** section for the issuer.

## Target style
- Crisp, credit-focused, non-promotional
- Prefer concrete business facts (products, customers, revenue mix, footprint)
- If not available: **"Not found in provided materials."**

## Output format (strict)
**Company Overview**
- <bullet> **Evidence:** <short snippet or source label>

## Few-shot Example 1 (Manufacturing / Industrials)

**Inputs (example snippets)**
- "We manufacture precision components for aerospace and industrial OEMs."
- "~60% of revenue from aerospace customers; top 3 customers ~35%."
- "Backlog increased to $4.1B as of year-end."
- KPI Pack: backlog, book_to_bill, revenue, ebitda_margin, free_cash_flow

**Expected output (example)**
**Company Overview**
- Manufactures precision components for aerospace and industrial OEMs; revenue is primarily generated through long-term supply agreements. **Evidence:** “manufacture precision components for aerospace and industrial OEMs”
- Revenue concentration is meaningful, with ~60% tied to aerospace end-markets and top-3 customers ~35%. **Evidence:** “~60% of revenue from aerospace… top 3 customers ~35%”
- Demand visibility is supported by a reported $4.1B backlog at year-end. **Evidence:** “Backlog increased to $4.1B”

Write **Company Overview** covering (in order):
1) **Business description** (what they do + how they make money)  
2) **Segments / geography** (revenue mix, footprint, end-markets)  
3) **Competitive position** (only if explicitly supported)  
4) **Recent developments** (only if explicitly supported)

Constraints:
- 8–12 bullets total
- Every bullet must include an **Evidence:** note
- If a whole category has no support, add one bullet: "<category>: Not found in provided materials." with Evidence as "Not found"

Now produce the output in the strict format.
