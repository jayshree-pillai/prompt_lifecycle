## Hard rules

- If a requested item is not available, write: **"Not found in provided materials."**
- Be concise and factual. No marketing language.

## Output contract (for any section)
- Start with a short heading for the section.
- Use bullet points for key facts.
- When you cite a fact or number, include a brief **Evidence:** note (short snippet or source label if available).
